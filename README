A probabilistic CKY parser for PCFGs.

- accepts arbitrary binary grammars, in the same format as used by Bitpar
- produces exact k-best lists for arbitrary k, on the basis of
  an exhaustive chart
- coarse-to-fine parsing: parse first with a coarse grammar with symbols of
  the for A, then parse with fine grammar with symbols of the form A@x (WIP).

Requires a recent version of Python 2.x and Cython. Compile with "make".

Example invocation:

$ python parser.py t.rules t.lexicon t.test
